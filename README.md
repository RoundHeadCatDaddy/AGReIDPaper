# 😎 Awesome Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification

Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification aims to match pedestrians across drone-captured aerial and ground camera views, facing challenges from viewpoint discrepancies, resolution variations, lighting conditions, and background interference. Critical for smart surveillance, traffic management, and emergency response, it focuses on deep learning models (e.g., cross-view feature alignment networks, self-supervised strategies) to improve cross-domain accuracy and robustness, advancing vision systems in real-world applications.
